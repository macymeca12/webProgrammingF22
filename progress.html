      I wanted to revamp an old project that i worked on last year. I was new to
      api so I wasnt too familiar with it. I decided that I wanted to get more
      into the world of javascript libraries so i decided to use React since i
      hear so much about it. The api i used was the Anime Api jkns.
    </p>
    <img src="img/setp1.png" alt="step1" style="width: 500px; height: 300px" />
    <p>
      While I was working on my original i found out i had a lot of errors in
      console log. The api link wan't working even though their was still
      sources for it on the api page. So i scrapped it and decided to start from
      new.

    <img src="img/step2.png" alt="step2" style="width: 500px; height: 300px" />
    <img src="img/step3.png" alt="step3" style="width: 500px; height: 300px" />
    <img src="img/setp4.png" alt="step4" style="width: 500px; height: 300px" />
    <p>
      In the final results you can save shows in your own list and can remove
      them. on the left side theres is some stats about the show. One thing i
      was stuck on and didn't realise last minute that i can't call the react
      page directly with github pages so i'm still trying to figure how to
      deploy a react app on github.
